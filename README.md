# Bitcoin-prediction

This repo about my Masterâ€™s Thesis.

The main concept: 
We will explore Bitcoin price prediction depending on the crisis. The hypothesis is whether we can train the neural network at the time when there was no crisis and what results it will give at the time when there is a crisis.

We distinguish three periods:
1. The shale crisis of 2014
2. Covid-19 crisis
3. Non-crisis data

I've compared two aproaches for this hypothesis : LSTM neaural network and SARIMAX statistical model.
The best resualt was given by the LSTM model.
